### Hi there 👋

Although my GitHub 🟩 may not show it, I've been actively engaged in programming for years!  My coding origin story began with some R and Python in 2019 while I was at Penn State studying Supply Chain & Information Systems.  During my two years at an Operations Leadership Program, I gained exposure to VBA and fostered an excitement about the capabilities of technology.  In July 2022, I decided to focus on technology full-time to improve my knowledge of web applications and graduated the University of Denver's full-stack coding bootcamp in October.

Current Goals:

💼 Receive a job offer that allows me to solve interesting problems.

📖 Improve coding best practices.  I'm ~500 pages into _Code Complete_ by Steve McConnell.

🔨 Build projects!

<br />

Current Project:

🏈 Start/Sit deficit tracker for ESPN fantasy football leagues. Check out the [repo](https://github.com/BrettMiller47/start-sit-deficit)!

📖 Improve PL SQL knowledge via Udemy course. (not on Github)

Other Info:

🤔 I’m looking for help with running a web-scraper in the background to serve data to the client.  Currently, I am using Selenium.
