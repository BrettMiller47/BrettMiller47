### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

While my GitHub ðŸŸ© may not show it, I've actually been interested and actively engaged in coding for years!  My coding origin story began some R and Python back in 2019.  When I joined the workforce with my Supply Chain & Information Systems degree, I was amazed at the speed reducing power of VBA.  Since I began focusing on coding full-time, I'm a recent graduate of the University of Denver's coding bootcamp for full-stack web development and I'm excited to see what I can build next!

ðŸ”­ Current Project -- Start/Sit deficit tracker for ESPN fantasy football leagues. Check it out the [repo](https://github.com/BrettMiller47/start-sit-deficit)!

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with running a web-scraper in the background to serve data to the client.  Selenium is my current scraper.
